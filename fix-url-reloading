Think hard.

For maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially.

If you create any temporary new files, scripts, or helper files for iteration, clean up these files by removing them at the end of the task.

Please write a high quality, general purpose solution. Implement a solution that works correctly for all valid inputs, not just the test cases. Do not hard-code values or create solutions that only work for specific test inputs. Instead, implement the actual logic that solves the problem generally.

Focus on understanding the problem requirements and implementing the correct algorithm. Tests are there to verify correctness, not to define the solution. Provide a principled implementation that follows best practices and software design principles.

If the task is unreasonable or infeasible, or if any of the tests are incorrect, please tell me. The solution should be robust, maintainable, and extendable.

There is currenlty a bug with the web app with the state is restored from the URL. 

The state is restored correcty but the analysis is not reran automatically like it should be.

Check to see if any integration test already checks for this behaviour. If so, verify that this test reproduces the error and then fix it.
If there is no such test then create a new one or adjust a new one and add a simple assertion that the analysis is automatically reran.
Make the test pass.
