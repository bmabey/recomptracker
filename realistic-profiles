Think hard.

For maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially.

If you create any temporary new files, scripts, or helper files for iteration, clean up these files by removing them at the end of the task.

Please write a high quality, general purpose solution. Implement a solution that works correctly for all valid inputs, not just the test cases. Do not hard-code values or create solutions that only work for specific test inputs. Instead, implement the actual logic that solves the problem generally.

Focus on understanding the problem requirements and implementing the correct algorithm. Tests are there to verify correctness, not to define the solution. Provide a principled implementation that follows best practices and software design principles.

If the task is unreasonable or infeasible, or if any of the tests are incorrect, please tell me. The solution should be robust, maintainable, and extendable.

Your task is:

To make the random profiles a bit more realistic. Right now every profile shows near constant improvement with every scan with very fast improvment going into athletic ranges. While some profiles should show this it may be demotivating to people to see all of these amazing performers. Lets have some profiles with more ups and downs and have some that don't end up at the high end of percentiles or Athtleic ranges of BF.
