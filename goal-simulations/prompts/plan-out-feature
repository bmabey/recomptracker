Think hard.

For maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially.

I don't wnat you to write any code yet. Instead, I want you to plan out the solution to implment the PRD as laied out in goal-simulations/prd.md.

Focus on understanding the problem requirements and proposing the correct way to break down this problem.
Provide a principled plans that follows best practices and software design principles.
The solution should be robust, maintainable, and extendable.

I want you to break down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts. For each part, I want you to write a markdown file that describes the part and proposes a list of tools that you would use to implement the part.
Each part should be written to goal-simulations/plans/0#-<part-name>.md
