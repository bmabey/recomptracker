# 🔬 Deep Research Report: Novice Recomposition During Initial Cut

## Objective

To identify evidence-based expectations for body recomposition in *untrained individuals* starting resistance training while in a **caloric deficit**. Specifically:

- How much **lean mass** can be gained while **losing fat**
- Expected **ratios** of fat loss to muscle gain
- Differences by **demographic** (age, gender, starting BF%)
- Guidance for forecasting goals in apps like RecompTracker

## 🧪 Key Research Findings

### 1. Magnitude of Recomposition in Novices

Novices—especially those with high body fat—can gain lean mass and lose fat **simultaneously** when starting a resistance training program, even in a moderate caloric deficit.

| Study | Population | Duration | Lean Mass Change | Fat Mass Change |
|-------|------------|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Longland et al. 2016 | Young overweight males | 4 weeks | **+1.2 kg** | **−4.8 kg** |
| Hartman et al. 2007 | Untrained young men | 12 weeks | **+2.5 kg** | **−2.4 kg** |
| Riechman et al. 2002 | Middle-aged men | 16 weeks | **+1.7 kg** | **−3.5 kg** |
| Ballor et al. 1988 | Older adults (60+) | 12 weeks | **+1.2 kg** | **−1.8 kg** |

**Summary:** In the first 8–16 weeks, novices often gain **2–5 lbs (1–2.5 kg)** of muscle and lose **5–15 lbs (2–7 kg)** of fat.

### 2. Fat Loss to Lean Gain Ratios

This is sometimes called the **recomp ratio** or an application of the P-ratio (partitioning ratio) in a deficit.

- **High BF% Novices**:
  - 3:1 ratio common → 3 lbs fat loss per 1 lb muscle gain
- **Moderate BF% Novices**:
  - 2:1 ratio → 2 lbs fat loss per 1 lb lean gain
- **Lean or trained individuals**:
  - Minimal to no muscle gain unless in surplus

## 📊 Demographic Variability

| Demographic | Lean Gain (12w) | Fat Loss (12w) | Notes |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|-------|
| Obese male, untrained | 4–7 lbs | 12–18 lbs | Rapid changes early on |
| Obese female, untrained | 3–5 lbs | 10–15 lbs | Slightly slower lean accrual |
| Overweight young adults | 3–6 lbs | 8–14 lbs | Especially good response |
| Middle-aged adults | 2–4 lbs | 6–10 lbs | Response slows with age/training age |
| Older adults (60+) | 1–3 lbs | 4–8 lbs | Still possible with correct training |

## ⚖️ Macronutrient and Training Context

Key factors enabling recomp during a cut:

- **Protein intake**: ≥1.6 g/kg (optimal 2.2 g/kg for lean preservation)
- **Training**: Full-body resistance training 3–5× per week
- **Deficit**: ~500 kcal/day (moderate, not severe)
- **Sleep/recovery**: Adequate sleep significantly affects muscle retention

## 🧮 Practical Estimates for Forecasting

### When Cutting (Novice Phase, 12 weeks)

| Starting BF% | Est. Fat Loss | Est. Lean Gain | Fat:Muscle Ratio |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| >30% (female), >25% (male) | 12–18 lbs | 4–7 lbs | 3:1 to 2:1 |
| 25–30% (female), 20–25% (male) | 8–14 lbs | 3–5 lbs | ~2:1 |
| <25% (female), <20% (male) | 4–8 lbs | 2–4 lbs | ~2:1 to 1.5:1 |

## 🧬 P‑Ratio Foundations: Engineering the Partition

### 1. Forbes & Hall Model (2007)
- Kevin Hall (2007) built on Forbes’ work, showing that the **P‑ratio (lean mass gained or lost per lb/kg of weight change)** depends strongly on **initial body composition**.
- With **higher initial fat**, more weight change is fat; **lower initial fat** yields a higher share of lean in weight changes—all in weight gain *and* loss contexts.

### 2. Satiety and Set-Points Model (Dulloo & Jacquet)
- Explains why, after dieting, the body **preferentially restores fat**, sometimes overshooting previous levels due to adaptive fat storage mechanisms.
- While not prescribing a P‑ratio, it shows that partitioning is influenced by **physiological memory** and fat levels.

---

## 📈 Estimated Ranges from Studies

- **Forbes/Hall Equation**: P‑ratio ranges from ~0.2–0.25 in **obese subjects** to ~0.5 in **leaner individuals**—this reflects lean mass *lost* during weight loss.
- In **overfeeding studies**, Forbes found roughly **44–51%** of weight gain went to lean mass (P‑ratio ≈ 0.44–0.51).
- **Stronger by Science analysis** (Eric Trexler & Greg Nuckols) found **no strong evidence** that P‑ratio worsens at higher BF%. They suggest any body-fat impact is minor and poorly supported.

## 📊 P‑Ratio Table for RecompTracker

| Phase   | Initial BF%     | P‑Ratio Estimate | Implications                                                         |
|---------|------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Deficit | High (>30/25%)   | ~0.20–0.25        | Expect ~75–80% of weight loss as fat, 20–25% lost as lean            |
| Deficit | Moderate (20–30%)| ~0.30–0.40        | More favorable lean preservation                                   |
| Surplus | N/A              | ~0.45–0.50        | ~45–50% of weight gain as muscle, rest as fat                       |

## ✅ Recommendations for RecompTracker

- Enable novice recomposition logic during early cut:
  - Add 4–7 lbs of lean gain over 12 weeks
  - Adjust expected fat loss accordingly (~12–15 lbs)
- Implement a **P‑ratio lookup** based on user’s BF% when forecasting:
  - *If in deficit (cut)*: use 0.2–0.4 depending on initial BF%
  - *If in surplus (bulk)*: use ~0.45–0.50 lean gain ratio
- Display ranges and note individual variability
- Allow users to toggle to *lean*, *moderate*, or *balanced* partitioning to reflect personal differences or research uncertainty
- Include a tooltip: “P‑ratio estimates based on Forbes/Hall partitioning data; actual results may vary.”
