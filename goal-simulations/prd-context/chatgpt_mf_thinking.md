# Summary of MacroFactor Articles and Recommendations for RecompTracker

## üìö Article Summaries

### 1. **Should I Bulk or Cut?**
- **Default advice**: Choose the path that excites you more.
- If unsure, **bulking** or **maintenance** is typically better for long-term muscle gain.
- **Cutting is recommended** if:
  - Men: >25% body fat
  - Women: >35% body fat
  - You have aesthetic or sport-specific goals
- **Bulking is recommended** if:
  - You want to build more muscle
  - You're below the above thresholds
- **Maintenance** allows for body recomposition (fat loss + muscle gain) at a slower rate.

### 2. **How Fast to Gain Weight When Bulking**
- **Rate depends on training experience**:

| Training Level | Conservative | Medium     | Aggressive | Max (lbs/week) |
|----------------|--------------|------------|------------|----------------|
| Beginner       | 0.2%         | 0.5%       | 0.8‚Äì1.0%   | 0.9‚Äì1.8        |
| Intermediate   | 0.15%        | 0.325%     | 0.575%     | 0.6‚Äì1.4        |
| Experienced    | 0.1%         | 0.15%      | 0.35‚Äì0.6%  | 0.2‚Äì1.0        |

- Gaining faster **does not proportionally improve muscle gain** in experienced lifters.
- **Best lean mass retention** occurs at ‚â§0.3‚Äì0.4% body weight/week.

### 3. **How Fast to Lose Weight When Cutting**
- **Recommended range**: 0.25%‚Äì1% of body weight/week  
  (‚âà 0.5‚Äì1.5 lbs/week for most people)
- Below ~0.8%/week = better muscle retention
- **Upper bound**: 2 lbs/week; beyond this, muscle loss and adherence issues increase
- Adjust rate based on:
  - Mood
  - Hunger
  - Performance
  - Motivation
