Think hard.

For maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially.

If you create any temporary new files, scripts, or helper files for iteration, clean up these files by removing them at the end of the task.

Please write a high quality, general purpose solution. Implement a solution that works correctly for all valid inputs, not just the test cases. Do not hard-code values or create solutions that only work for specific test inputs. Instead, implement the actual logic that solves the problem generally.

Focus on understanding the problem requirements and implementing the correct algorithm. Tests are there to verify correctness, not to define the solution. Provide a principled implementation that follows best practices and software design principles.

If the task is unreasonable or infeasible, or if any of the tests are incorrect, please tell me. The solution should be robust, maintainable, and extendable.

The feature that needs to be implemented:

In the streamlit webapp.py there is a User Profile section. When the training level is inferred a helpful message is displayed about it. However, I don't like how it pushes down other buttons in the UI. What options do we have to keep this functionatlity but not be disruptive to the UI?

Ask me clarifying questions before proceeding. After your changes you should ensure all the test pass by running "task test-all"
