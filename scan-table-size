Think hard.

For maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially.

If you create any temporary new files, scripts, or helper files for iteration, clean up these files by removing them at the end of the task.

Please write a high quality, general purpose solution. Implement a solution that works correctly for all valid inputs, not just the test cases. Do not hard-code values or create solutions that only work for specific test inputs. Instead, implement the actual logic that solves the problem generally.

Focus on understanding the problem requirements and implementing the correct algorithm. Tests are there to verify correctness, not to define the solution. Provide a principled implementation that follows best practices and software design principles.

If the task is unreasonable or infeasible, or if any of the tests are incorrect, please tell me. The solution should be robust, maintainable, and extendable.

The feature request:

Right now the "Changes So Far" has a number of "Changes" columns. 

Instead of having the columns I want a single row at the bottom saying "Changes" so that the deltas can be dispalyed on that row versus as columns. Steps do do:

1. add a new Changes row. Have it be visuale separated by a thick line border. Have the work Changes in the "Date" column and have the word be bolded and with the same background as the header row
2. pivot the change values into that row
3. preserve the css logic so that the changes are approcpiated coded based on the metric being displayed
